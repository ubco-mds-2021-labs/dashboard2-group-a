## Git Workflow

All team members agree to the Feature Branching] workflow, and the following conventions (e.g., master branch protection, at least 1 review before a pull request):

* Git Feature Branch Workflow
    * We will create new branches off of main for different features of the app (layout components, data pipeline, architecture, etc)
    * We will make commits frequently with commit messages onto these branches describing the contents of our work.
    * When we reach reasonable sized checkpoints of "ready" work, we will create pull requests.
    * We will review each other's pull requests, provide feedback, or pull in the request if approved as needed.

* The `main` branch should be clean, predictable, and functional code. 
    * Pull-requests should not be approved if code harms functionality of the `main` branch.
    * Unless minimal or for a good reason, changes should not be made directly to the `main` branch.
